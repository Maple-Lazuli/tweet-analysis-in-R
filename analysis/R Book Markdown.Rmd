# Chapter 10 - Text Mining

## 10.2 Transforming Text

The first step in this section was to the twitter data to a dataframe, however, this is something that was already achieved in the preliminary step.

```{r}
datatable(df)
```

The next step was to convert the text to a corpus. The text used the `tm` package to achieve this.

```{r}
myCorpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(df$tweet))
```

Then, the text was converted to lower case by using the builtin function `tolower()` and the `tm_map` function from the `tm` package.

```{r}
myCorpus <- tm_map(myCorpus, tolower)
```
